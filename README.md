## Project 1: N-Tier Architecture

The N-Tier Architecture project focuses on designing and implementing a web application using the N-Tier architectural pattern. The project demonstrates the separation of concerns into distinct layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access. It emphasizes the modularity, scalability, and maintainability of the application.

## Project 2: Modular Monolithic

The Modular Monolithic project explores an alternative approach to traditional monolithic architecture. It demonstrates how to break down a monolithic application into smaller, modular components while still maintaining a single deployable unit. This project showcases the benefits of modularity, ease of development, and independent scaling of modules.

## Project 3: Microservices

The Microservices project focuses on building a web application using a microservices architecture. It showcases the decomposition of the application into small, independent services that communicate with each other via APIs. This project highlights the advantages of scalability, fault isolation, and ease of deployment offered by microservices.

## Project 4: Message Queuing

The Message Queuing project explores the use of message queues in a web application architecture. It demonstrates how to implement asynchronous communication between different components using message brokers. This project emphasizes the benefits of decoupling, resilience, and scalability achieved through message queuing.

## Project 5: Pub-Sub Model

The Pub-Sub Model project showcases the implementation of a publish-subscribe architectural pattern. It illustrates how different components can communicate through a pub-sub system, enabling loose coupling and event-driven interactions. This project highlights the flexibility, extensibility, and real-time capabilities offered by the pub-sub model.
